# labrador-sea-oxygen

This repository contains code used for a paper submitted to Frontiers in Marine Science, titled "Decadal variability of oxygen uptake, export, and storage in the Labrador Sea from observations and CMIP6 models" on April 7, 2023.

#### April 7, 2023
As of this writing, we are still finalizing the transfer of code to a jupyter notebook to be uploaded here, but intend to do so within the next few weeks. The notebook will contain code to calculate a ''model score'' for CMIP6 models relative to observations of oxygen in the Labrador Sea as described in the paper. The intend use is both to allow readers to better follow the discussion in the paper, and to enable users to calculate a score for different models to compare with the CMIP6 models analyzed here
