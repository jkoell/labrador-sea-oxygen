# labrador-sea-oxygen

This repository contains code used for a paper submitted to Frontiers in Marine Science, titled "Decadal variability of oxygen uptake, export, and storage in the Labrador Sea from observations and CMIP6 models" on April 7, 2023.

#### April 14, 2023
Added code for the calculation of the model score. Current version includes examples for CMIP6 gridded model data from MIROC E2SL, NCAR CESM2 and NOAA GFDL. Note that the CMIM data are currently not uploaded on GitHub, so to run the code the user would have to separately download the data.
